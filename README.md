# Shen_Mansells_commented_code
This is code made by Shen Mansell that I altered to explain how setting tile palette works.
Note that I just set a blue square to explain how
setting background colours using a background palette works.
Be sure to look in the BGB vram to see the colour palettes loaded in memory.
I do not take credit for making the bung logo tiles or bung map metatiles.
The original code and tile and map data was made by
Shen Mansell (shenmansell@hotmail.com)                                                                                                     
his website is http://shen.mansell.tripod.com   
Note: His example was from 2000 - 2001, therefore his contact information maybe out of data.
